Created my own Data set with the below: 


What are average, max, and min values in the data?
What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?


/* Put your data in here and query it! */

CREATE TABLE cars (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, popularity INTEGER, alignment TEXT, town_name TEXT, speed INTEGER, durability INTEGER);

INSERT INTO cars VALUES(1, "Van", 1, "yes", "Spencer", 50, 10);

--- print table 
SELECT * FROM cars;

Shows all the database schema.

--- what is the average popularity rate and Max and Min speeds of the data? 
SELECT AVG(popularity) FROM cars; SELECT MAX(speed)FROM cars; SELECT MIN(speed) FROM cars;

AVG(popularity)
4.2

MAX(speed)
80

MIN(speed)
5

--- USE HAVING to aggregate 
SELECT COUNT(popularity), town_name FROM cars GROUP BY town_name HAVING COUNT(popularity) >= 3;


COUNT(popularity),	town_name
4,	Marlborough
6,	Spencer


--- CASE example 
SELECT speed, 
CASE
WHEN speed < 30 THEN "Slow"
WHEN speed > 30 THEN "Fast" 
ELSE "Quality Low"
End AS Speed_Description
FROM cars;

Table pulled shows below:

--- Using AND function with data table. 
SELECT name, town_name 
FROM cars
WHERE town_name ="Spencer" AND name = "Van"

name	town_name
Van	Spencer
Van	Spencer
Van	Spencer
